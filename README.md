# applied-ai-lab

A GitHub-ready portfolio lab for Venkat to build small, useful AI products in 3-6 hour weekend sprints.

The goal is to learn modern AI engineering by shipping demoable projects: agents, RAG, structured outputs, evals, MCP-style tools, memory, multimodal workflows, and model routing. Each project should be simple enough to finish quickly, but polished enough to show on a resume.

## Portfolio Rules

Each project in this repo should:

- Be demoable in under 2 minutes.
- Teach one or two current AI engineering concepts.
- Include a `README.md`, architecture notes, example prompts, and a tiny eval.
- Run locally with minimal setup.
- Solve a recognizable user problem instead of feeling like coursework.
- Follow the shared [cost and prompt caching standard](docs/COST_OPTIMIZATION.md).

| 13 | Equity Research Lab | source-grounded financial research, provider abstraction, immutable prediction snapshots, retrospective evals | MVP |

## Weekend Workflow

1. Pick one project from `ROADMAP.md`.
2. Keep the first version intentionally small.
3. Add one screenshot or short demo recording after it works.
4. Add 3-5 eval cases before calling it complete.
5. Write a resume bullet that explains the engineering concept and user value.
6. Complete the [project shipping checklist](templates/PROJECT_CHECKLIST.md), including cache and cost measurements.

## Getting Started With Project 01

```bash
cd projects/01-personal-chief-of-staff
python3 -m app.server
```

Then open `http://localhost:8000`.

The app works in mock mode with no API keys. Add `OPENAI_API_KEY` or `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` to use a real model.

## GitHub Profile

Designed for ongoing additions under [geeveeyes](https://github.com/geeveeyes).

## Project 02

```bash
cd projects/02-deep-research-briefing
python3 -m app.server
```

Open `http://127.0.0.1:8002` and choose **Load example**. See the [Project 02 README](projects/02-deep-research-briefing/README.md) for API key setup and scope.


## Project 13

```bash
cd projects/13-equity-research-lab
cp .env.example .env.local
npm install
npm run dev
```

Equity Research Lab runs in demo mode without API keys and is designed to add SEC, analyst, options, persistence, and retrospective-evaluation providers incrementally. See the [Project 13 README](projects/13-equity-research-lab/README.md).
