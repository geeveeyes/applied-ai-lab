**Current holder:** Codex on `codex/thesis-review`; dated review milestone ready for release. Prior state: none. Connected-portfolio interlink is merged in [PR #7](https://github.com/geeveeyes/applied-ai-lab/pull/7) as `4758c63`; both Vercel production checks passed.
**Last updated:** 2026-10-04 by Codex
**Main baseline:** `eedfaee` (PR #8 agent-guide update atop PR #7).
**Latest feature commit:** `4758c63` (PR #7 connected-portfolio flow); latest docs commit: `eedfaee` (PR #8 completion-status reporting rule).
**Validation:** 163 tests, type check and production build passed (`NEXT_TELEMETRY_DISABLED=1`) for PR #8; both Vercel production checks passed for the PR #7 merge. PR #8 changes documentation only and does not change the live deployment. Production pages previously loaded behind Vercel authentication. Venkat reports server-only SnapTrade environment variables are configured; the first live refresh and statement reconciliation remain unverified.
**Notion plan:** https://app.notion.com/p/3eddf6e02bd78120a3fcf8f8cc768af1

## State

**Dated investment-case review milestone:** user authorized autonomous iteration while AFK. Engine v0.13.0 and the existing equity research skill adapt falsifiable conditions and business-specific questions from the reviewed package. New full reports include up to three dated/source-linked observations, proposed change conditions, reported or suggested review dates and evidence gaps. My holdings shows review status and saved-report links through Next Link. Deterministic guards withhold unsupported observations; review dates do not alter verdicts. 180 tests, TypeScript and production build pass. Local synthetic saved-report and holdings browser checks pass, without paid research or brokerage access. Fresh live report output remains unverified. No migration. Details and next priorities: `docs/THESIS_REVIEW_2026-10-04.md`.

**Personal dashboard milestone 1:** user approved all six milestones and cost controls. PR #6 merged as `efb4d89`; the `/accounts` page is deployed and loaded behind Vercel authentication. It offers manual read-only Fidelity and Robinhood refresh, account type, brokerage-reported total, explicit cash, positions and provider timestamps. Other institutions are skipped before per-account requests. Data remains in page memory, is not archived, and no AI calls or trades are made. The endpoint is POST-only and same-origin. Venkat reports that server-only SnapTrade variables are configured; first live refresh and statement reconciliation are still pending. Keep Vercel Deployment Protection → All Deployments enabled. The existing workspace cookie remains anonymous. No secrets or brokerage records are stored. Read `docs/PERSONAL_CONNECTION_PILOT.md` before proceeding. Monarch has an official MCP, currently under maintenance; none is connected here.

**Personal dashboard interlink milestone:** commit `036bd5b` adds one tab-memory snapshot shared through in-app navigation. Connected positions feed My holdings, report-level position context, Portfolio Lab and the generalized holding-diversification page. My holdings keeps data in memory by default; the owner must click Save to persist a browser copy. Connected Portfolio Lab runs locally and does not send account-derived amounts to the portfolio save API. The generic diversification page accepts any held stock or fund and compares keeping, 25%/50%/75%/100% immediate trims and a staged 50% trim. Its assumptions are editable and explicitly illustrative. Portfolio Lab starts with the current mix versus an equal-weight non-cash mix; zero return/risk placeholders must be replaced or supplemented before interpreting a run. Direct-stock, sector, AMZN and unknown-fund flags remain account-scoped. Missing/unsupported positions and possible account overlap mark the portfolio partial. Reloading clears the connected snapshot. Validation: 163 tests, TypeScript and production build pass.

**Fidelity import repair:** the reported upload failure was an income CSV selected in the positions importer. The provided positions CSV parses. New import review sits at the top, names the selected file/errors, requires choosing one account from multi-account exports, shows AMZN/cash/basis/date summaries and links to the AMZN workflow. Unlisted row values remain in account totals; linked-account overlap is flagged. Total basis takes precedence over rounded average basis. Download timestamp is shown separately from the snapshot date. Local browser upload/save/AMZN transfer verified with the provided file; no raw file, account identifiers or personal figures are committed. Two synthetic regression tests added.

**Current delivery (Codex):** recovered Claude's missing four commits from `equity-part2-import-scoring-backtest.mbox`, preserving authorship. Branch includes broker CSV import, one scoring model and the exploratory backtest. Engine v0.12.0 fixes the 15% margin, stale/unsupported quick-check signals, full-report priority, partial CSV coverage and cash-flow convention. Direct-stock concentration now excludes cash from the effective-count calculation and flags incomplete fund exposure. Provider calls now reserve attempts atomically before work; failures count. No database migration required. Review: `docs/REVIEW_2026-09-30_codex.md`. Older dated entries below describe prior states.


v0.9 engine is deployed at https://13-equity-research-lab.vercel.app (live mode, FMP + SEC + Alpha Vantage + OpenAI, Supabase archive).
It has research reports, a 6-factor investment decision, peer valuation for 13 hard-coded sectors, cited web briefs,
a holdings workspace, Portfolio Lab (Monte Carlo) and an AMZN decision workspace.
Codex paused on 2026-09-25 because of credit limits. Claude reviewed the project on 2026-09-30: `docs/REVIEW_2026-09-30_claude.md`.


**Session 3b (same branch):** broker CSV import (Fidelity/Schwab/Vanguard/generic, `lib/broker-import.ts`); one scoring model (AI no longer asked for the unused 12-dimension scorecard → fewer tokens per report; `run.score` = six-factor score; SKILL.md rewritten, engine v0.11.0); point-in-time backtest of DCF zones at `/backtest` (`lib/backtest.ts`, SEC facts filed-by-date + actual price, 12m excess vs SPY).

**2026-09-30 Claude session 3 (branch `claude/quick-check-watchlist`, not merged).** Steering from Venkat: personal portfolio decisions first; a generic tool is the future vision (see `docs/PRODUCT_STRATEGY.md`).
- **Quick check** (`lib/quick-check.ts`, `/api/quick-check`): AI-free DCF snapshot, zone (Buy zone ≥15% margin / Fair / Expensive / Not valued), buy-below price. Metered by `QUICK_CHECK_DAILY_CAP` (default 60) in `equity_provider_usage` (no migration), cached per ticker per day.
- **Watchlist** (`/watchlist`): browser-private list, check all, ranked table, diversification ideas for sectors not held.
- **Position decisions** (`lib/position-advice.ts`) on /holdings: ordered rules (concentration > recent full report > quick-check zone) → Trim to limit / Review selling / Trim candidate / Hold / Hold, don't add / Add candidate; optional average cost → tax note. Reprice holdings from today's checks. **Decision journal** graded against later prices.
- **Find stocks** is quick-screen first (10 or ~45 names), full reports for finalists. Report shows buy-below + DCF sensitivity grid. Home page is portfolio-first. Report holding panel limit 20%→10%.

**2026-09-30 Claude session 2 (merged as PR #2):**
- **Vercel:** Deployment Protection switched from *Standard* (which left the production URL public) to **All Deployments**. The live app now requires a Vercel login on the team. Done in the dashboard, no code.
- **P0 code guard:** `/company/[ticker]` no longer runs research on GET (shows today's saved report or a Run button). `/api/analyze` is POST-only + same-origin. Global daily cap on new live reports (`RESEARCH_DAILY_CAP`, default 15, counted from saved snapshots, fails closed without DB). Same-day same-ticker reuse. Opportunities screen uses POST and stops at the cap. `robots.txt` + `X-Robots-Tag: noindex`.
- **Valuation:** `lib/intrinsic-valuation.ts` deterministic DCF (FCF, or net income when capex > 60% of OCF; consensus revenue CAGR clamped −5..25% fading to 2.5%; 10/9/8% discount; + net cash from SEC). Excludes banks/insurers; caps cyclicals and no-forecast cases. `lib/valuation-factor.ts` sets the valuation factor in code (more conservative of DCF vs complete peer table). Scenarios are now intrinsic bear/base/bull, not price-anchored. Engine v0.10.0.
- **Diversification:** holdings page gets a concentration check (single-stock/sector limits, trim-to-limit $, effective # of stocks, top-5).
- **Learn loop (v1):** `/performance` grades frozen reports against later saved reports of the same ticker (30/90/180/365d). Zero API cost.
- **CI:** `.github/workflows/equity-research-lab.yml` (tsc, test, build).

## Next up (in order)

1. Venkat: refresh `/accounts` and confirm holdings remain available while navigating to My holdings, Portfolio Lab and Diversify a holding. Reconcile account coverage, totals and dates against the brokers; record status only, never raw values. Reloading should clear the in-memory snapshot.
2. Build the next approved decision milestone on the shared portfolio: compare destination allocations and staged reductions with clearer cost-basis and uncertainty handling. Keep alternatives user-editable and avoid forced Buy labels.
3. Then continue fund look-through, Monarch where its official MCP is available, historical ROI (XIRR/TWR only with sufficient dates/flows), and prospective benchmark validation. No automatic sync/research or trades.

## Open questions for Venkat

- Venkat reports that separate SnapTrade Personal credentials are configured in Vercel. The existing ChatGPT SnapTrade connection does not supply credentials to this website. Do not share any key through chat or Notion. First live refresh remains unverified.

- ~~Auth~~ Decided: Vercel Deployment Protection, All Deployments. ~~Daily cap~~ Set to 5 by Venkat (2026-09-30).
- Are the 10% single-stock / 30% sector defaults right for you? (Editable per session on /holdings.)
- Is a 15% margin of safety the right "buy zone" threshold?
- Generic-tool direction: see `docs/PRODUCT_STRATEGY.md`. The narrow candidate is an educational concentration planner for stock-comp employees.
- FMP plan upgrade vs an SEC-only tier for mid-caps?

## Log

### 2026-10-02 — Codex: project completion status rule (PR #8, merged)
- Added the required final report for GitHub code/docs and PR state, Notion context/action state, live deployment and end-to-end verification, and remaining owner/action. Deployment checks must be distinguished from user-flow verification.
- Updated the shared Notion Agent Handoff Contract and Equity Research Lab project page. The matching repository rule in `AGENTS.md` merged as [PR #8](https://github.com/geeveeyes/applied-ai-lab/pull/8), squash commit `eedfaee`.
- TypeScript, all 163 tests and production build pass. Documentation only; live portal unchanged. Latest production verification remains PR #7's passing Vercel checks; live brokerage refresh remains unverified.
- Next: Venkat verifies the account refresh through the linked workspaces and reconciles coverage/dates against statements.

### 2026-10-02 — Codex: connected portfolio interlink (PR #7, merged)
- One read-only refresh now feeds account review, My holdings, Portfolio Lab and a symbol-selectable holding trim comparison through tab memory and in-app navigation.
- Portfolio Lab keeps connected runs in the browser session; six strategies compare keep, 25%, 50%, 75%, 100% trims and a staged 50% trim. Missing/unsupported exposure remains visible as partial coverage.
- 163 tests, TypeScript and production build pass. [PR #7](https://github.com/geeveeyes/applied-ai-lab/pull/7) squash-merged as `4758c63`; both Vercel production checks passed. Live data/reconciliation remains unverified.
- Next: Venkat verifies one refresh through all linked pages and reconciles broker coverage/dates without recording financial figures. Then continue the approved allocation-comparison milestone.

### 2026-10-01 — Codex: portal merged and deployed
- PR #6 merged as `efb4d89`; Vercel production deployment uses that main commit. The live `/accounts` page loads while signed in through Vercel Authentication. Vercel Deployment Protection is enabled in the project settings.
- Venkat reports server-only SnapTrade variables are configured. The manual account refresh has not yet been clicked, so live holdings, coverage, provider dates and refresh repeatability are unverified.
- 156 tests, TypeScript, production build and GitHub Actions run 14 passed. No financial values or secrets recorded. Holder released to none.

### 2026-10-01 — Codex: connected accounts portal step
- Added `/accounts` with manual Fidelity/Robinhood reads, account coverage and freshness; excluded other institutions before reading positions/balances. Result is held only in page memory.
- Endpoint is same-origin POST-only and feature-disabled by default; no trades, AI calls, recurring sync, combined total or persistent raw financial data.
- 156 tests, TypeScript and production build pass. No real portal credentials; live refresh remains unverified. Next: owner adds server-only Personal API key after confirming Vercel All Deployments protection, then reconcile two refreshes.
- Code commit: `9444846`; pushed as head `479a3df`. GitHub Actions passed. Draft PR #6 updated; holder released to none.

### 2026-10-01 — Codex: personal connection pilot
- Approved milestones and cost policy saved in Notion; setup and implementation tasks created, decision updated.
- `df1aeea`: private read-only adapter and local check; 155 tests/types/build pass. SDK Axios override avoids introducing its pinned dependency advisory; existing baseline advisories remain.
- Live setup/reconciliation, owner access, storage and scheduling remain outstanding. No account modifications or trades.

- **2026-09-30 · Codex Fidelity upload repair.** Corrected confusing import feedback and multi-account handling; preserved unlisted value, exact basis and explicit date uncertainty. Baseline 146 tests; final suite 148 tests. PR #5 merged as `7163f22`; all checks passed. See Notion for production verification. Baton released.

- **2026-09-30 · Codex delivery complete.** PR #4 merged as `f9ed0fd`, code head `e191172`; 146 tests, type check, build and CI passed. Recovered all four Claude commits; corrected concentration, valuation, decision priority and usage reservation. Browser verification uses illustrative data only. Shared review and next priorities are in Notion; no owner push/merge action remains.

- **2026-09-30 · Codex shared review.** Reviewed `50439a1` and Notion; recovered four missing Claude commits (134 baseline tests). Corrected decision/valuation regressions and added atomic usage reservations. Final suite 146 tests; reviewed math against CFA/Damodaran cash-flow conventions. Branch `codex/shared-tool-review`; code at `855b8de`. No claims of proven investment returns. See Codex review for remaining gaps.

- **2026-09-30 · Claude (session 3b).** Broker CSV import, one scoring model, zone backtest. 134 tests. Branch not pushed (session lacks push access).
- **2026-09-30 · Claude (session 3).** Branch `claude/quick-check-watchlist`: AI-free quick checks, watchlist, per-holding decisions, decision journal, quick-screen, sensitivity grid, portfolio-first home, product strategy doc. 123 tests. Not pushed; delivered as patch series.
- **2026-09-30 · Claude (session 2).** Vercel protection → All Deployments. Branch `claude/p0-lockdown-and-valuation`: P0 cost guard, deterministic DCF valuation, diversification check, zero-cost track record, CI. 106 tests. Not pushed (session lacks repo push access); delivered as patch series.
- **2026-09-30 · Claude.** Reviewed the codebase and added `AGENTS.md`, `CLAUDE.md`, `HANDOFF.md` and `docs/REVIEW_2026-09-30_claude.md`. No product code changed.
- **2026-09-25 · Codex.** Last feature commit `2e26aed`: peer valuation inputs and reference limitations.
