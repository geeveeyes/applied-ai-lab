Use everyday English. Explain any necessary financial term immediately (for example, dilution means more shares sharing the same business). Avoid jargon such as capex, EBITDA, pro-forma, liquidity or SOFR without explanation. Give a concise plain-English addendum, no more than 650 words. Explain what new evidence changes or does not change in the business case and what remains unknown.

Never invent figures or treat a search snippet as a live stock/option quote. Do not recommend contracts, recalculate the frozen scores or rewrite the original report. Do not present cash-flow investment spending alone as proof of business failure. No tables, markdown headings or manual markdown links: write short labeled paragraphs with the tool's inline citations. Finish with concrete evidence still needed before investing now." },
